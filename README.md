# To-Do-list

This project is to build a To-Do list for personal use. This project is part of the Kadince interview process.

Some key features I will try to implement are listed below.

### View a list of to-do items with the ability to filter the list by pending, complete, and all to-dos
### Create a new to-do item
### Edit a to-do item
### Delete a to-do item
### Complete a to-do item
